I haven't been frustrated with the Godot docs once so far, which is more than I can say for anything else.

I find the Godot docs inspiring just because of their quality relative to many other API docs, plus the responsiveness and pace of updating them.

Using a full-fledged game engine for the first time since 2010.

A nice thing about a game engine is you can get inspired by just browsing the documentation.

(It's Godot BTW.)

Not sure that I've ever felt as satisfied with a project as this one. It's been a month and I don't even hate it yet.
