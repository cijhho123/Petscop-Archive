Thank you for including the Garalina Helper Maker in your application.

In case you need an introduction, the Helper Maker allows certain choice parts of a program or game to be passed without any trouble. The program must be altered to read a Helper Code, and the user must input the code in image form (called an "Image Code") in order for the helper to be of any use.

To properly use a helper, store a code for usage and place it in a folder named "Inf". Once code is properly given by the user, allow for a helper. Helper must be placed in that same folder, or else it will not reach the code. Do not use the helper before it is needed, this is known to cause problems.

The Helper Maker can also be used with PASS.PASS, but it is recommended that you be an intelligent person before using it. To use PASS.PASS, keep it in the directory it was created in, then run Helper Maker.

Please include this Helper Maker Readme file with your application.
