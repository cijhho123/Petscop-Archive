YOU CANNOT SEE THE WALL
BUT ALSO, YOU CANNOT SEE THE BUTTON

THINK,
WHAT IS THE NUMBER THAT YOU HAVE REACHED SO FAR?
THINK,
WHAT IS THE SECOND DIGIT OF THAT NUMBER?
THINK,
HOW MANY PIXELS DOES THAT NUMBER HAVE?

15. IS HAS 15. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A YELLOW PIXEL.
1/15 PIXELS TURN YELLOW. SECOND DIGIT.

ALSO, YOUR MOUSE HAS MORE THAN ONE BUTTON. MAKE USE OF THAT FACT.

ONE LAST THING:
IT MAY BE OBVIOUS, BUT TRY INVERTING THE COLORS OF SOMETHING.
IT'S EASY.
