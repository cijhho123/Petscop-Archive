<h2>Summary, Or Something Like That</h2>
<p><strong>Tapers</strong> is a little story about troubled people.</p>
<p>It's also about Tapers, the wonderful (and slightly mysterious?) camera store with one employee and one customer.</p>
<p>It's probably also a story about the hopes and dreams of an elderly kidnapper, and his kidnapee, an 8-year-old girl.</p>
<p>But Tapers is, perhaps, a little more than that. There may be something else in there, hiding. Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
