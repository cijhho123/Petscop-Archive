## What is Petscop? 
Petscop is a YouTube horror web series by Tony Domenico, made to resemble a YouTube Let's Play series. The videos follow "Paul", the protagonist, exploring and documenting a supposedly "long-lost PlayStation video game" titled Petscop. The 24-episode series ran from March 12, 2017, to September 2, 2019. The series received widespread coverage for its storytelling, authenticity, surrealism, and its active community of viewers.

Petscop can be watched on the official [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Petscop).

## Plot Synopsis
Petscop is a video series that documents the experiences of Paul, our unsuspecting protagonist as he plays through an unknown and seemingly unfinished PS1 game the enigmatically titled "Petscop". Paul is uploading recordings of its early levels to prove to his friend that "the game he found" is real. 

Initially, the game seems like a standard PlayStation puzzle game, capturing strange creatures known as "pets" by solving puzzles. Howver, as the plot progresses, Paul is starting to uncover dark secrets buried by the past. And trying to deal with the increasingly tense situation when the border between real life events and Petscop are starting to blur.

"In a way, recordings have the power to raise the dead. They're kind of scary."


You can watch Nightmare Masterclass great investigation of Petscop on his [Youtube channel](https://youtu.be/Crvn5-LOUFA?si=Wqk7LwRFSOpoTNYG).

## So what actually is this?
Unlike some web-series, Petscop does not fit neatly into any singular genre. 

The series is presented in the form of "let's play" style videos. The series takes inspiration both from horror or "creepypasta" stories such as Ben Drowned and Marble Hornets, and surrealist films like Inland Empire and other films by David Lynch.

Petscop is not an alternate reality game (ARG), though it is often mistaken as one. Petscop is only aesthetically similar to ARGs, and does not explicitly identify itself as fiction. ARGs typically have some degree of interaction between the audience and the creator(s) of the ARG, or other official content that may be found externally, such as on hidden websites, or in some cases in the real world. 
 
Saying that - A lot of insight into this very cryptic story can be gained by utilizing techniques commonly used in ARGs.
