00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:08,580
[Music]

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,580
you

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,239
[Music]

4
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:18,239
you

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,730
you

6
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:02,908
that's kind of fun actually going

7
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:05,429
through a for our video and noticing

8
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:08,068
that on one half of the video the window

9
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,120
is going in one direction and and the

10
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:14,158
other half it's going in the other

11
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:30,478
direction and pinpointing where the

12
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:32,810
change occurred and is this that's

13
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,810
neat

14
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:53,860
well that's red now oh yeah I was going

15
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,959
to mention this actually in a another

16
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,300
video I've come up here before and seen

17
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:02,409
it I've seen the camera at this height

18
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:05,379
before I don't know what causes it to

19
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,350
happen but sometimes I just come up here

20
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,879
and it's at this height it makes sense

21
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,439
in this case I think is that the

22
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,680
character was like right up at the

23
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:33,759
camera here and it seems to be like at

24
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:44,189
this level well this is still here oh my

25
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:44,189
god nothing else okay come on

26
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,508
Oh

27
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:42,879
uh-uh

28
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,389
I was the only one who still wanted to

29
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,389
put him down

30
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,900
what of what have I just walked into

31
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:42,350
that's it yeah okay okay so I actually

32
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:47,300
this is this is new to me I had seen

33
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:50,240
this yeah so I tried going down here

34
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,600
before but I think actually that was

35
00:07:50,240 --> 00:08:00,259
before I even put in the code so I just

36
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:02,540
discovered this just now but you know

37
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:07,120
what I think actually this I think I

38
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:12,050
know what this is this is our a/b NLM

39
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,480
you recognize the shape of this one now

40
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:20,960
you help so I don't know what this is

41
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:24,470
here though yeah so I didn't imagine you

42
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,060
could catch this I mean oh I walked into

43
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,420
it

44
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,420
nothing happened

45
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm covering a lot of interesting things

46
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:47,729
but I meant to talk about this because

47
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,639
this doesn't do anything right this menu

48
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,959
option nothing happens I'm guessing at

49
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,809
some point you could one of your pets

50
00:08:51,958 --> 00:09:02,909
but uh well it's just like suggestions

51
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:04,019
or something yeah yes so well showing of

52
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:08,179
it that doesn't do anything

53
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,179
well Wow all right

54
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,089
you

55
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,549
you

56
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:19,370
this game is trying very hard to make it

57
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:19,370
seem like like there's an entity in it

58
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:32,550
like a ghost or an AI trying to

59
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:35,370
communicate with me it's interesting but

60
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:37,349
you know the way you know that there's a

61
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,560
ghost in a game trying to communicate

62
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:44,670
with you is if it comes out if it stops

63
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:48,539
being distant and it comes out and you

64
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:55,019
can have a you know a real time back and

65
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:57,870
forth with it and it stops being so

66
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,679
one-way like I I leave my PlayStation

67
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:09,690
and it comes comes out and does this

68
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:12,079
whole pre-recorded thing and well the

69
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,730
closest thing that's happened to that is

70
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,580
last video you know it actually answers

71
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,350
my questions but you know it only

72
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,660
responded to two of my questions and the

73
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,720
first one the first question I asked I

74
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:27,990
didn't even answer that question so no

75
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,759
obvious interactivity happening you know

76
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,399
then it answered the second question but

77
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:40,259
that could have been a coincidence yeah

78
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:42,088
so uh not entirely convincing yet but

79
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:46,129
you know looking forward to what I might

80
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:48,240
see next is very interesting this game

81
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:52,559
because you couldn't walk around and

82
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,519
something will just happen you know if I

83
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,979
created a new file and I tried to be

84
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,600
scientific about it I went I went and

85
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,970
did all the same things that I did this

86
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,970
time and the same things did not happen

87
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,460
none of the things happen none of the

88
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:15,330
oddities occurred like the thick of the

89
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,860
mirror room for example so there's a bit

90
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,270
of randomness in it and it's interesting

91
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:28,300
how it doesn't seem to really care

92
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:30,689
if you see everything I guess yeah so

93
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,689
it's interesting

94
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,509
you
