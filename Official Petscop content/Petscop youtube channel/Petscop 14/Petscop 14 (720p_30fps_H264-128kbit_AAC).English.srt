00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:49,509
[Music]

3
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,509
you

4
00:01:53,649 --> 00:02:06,819
I can't just wait thankfully I have been

5
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:10,060
suddenly inspired by an idea that is in

6
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:15,310
a way similar to the idea that brought

7
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:19,269
me to this house because that idea

8
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:23,229
involved pretending pretending something

9
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:25,959
was there that wasn't there and this

10
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:30,369
idea involves pretending that this door

11
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:33,959
right here this one it is open rather

12
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,879
than closed you can see that it's closed

13
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,549
but what I'm going to do and what I

14
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,370
invite you to do as well is picture I'm

15
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:46,750
going to picture in my head that this

16
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:50,259
door is actually open right now and if I

17
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,348
were to pass through this doorway what

18
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:57,370
would happen I would would I bump into a

19
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:59,409
door no because the door is open right I

20
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,730
would just keep going into the room

21
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,250
that's there and I happen to know I'm

22
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:05,138
gonna walk into the room right now that

23
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm in the room I happen to know what

24
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:10,090
this room looks like because I saw in a

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,609
demo recording just today and you can

26
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,319
see it too I assume it will be up on the

27
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:18,310
family YouTube along with this video

28
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:20,138
that I am recording right now we can see

29
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:25,199
what the room looks like in that

30
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:31,930
recording on the right right left left

31
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:33,009
right side there's a windmill oh I don't

32
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,430
have it in front of me right now I

33
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:37,929
should on the right side there's a

34
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,379
windmill on the left side there is

35
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:47,139
something that Marvin does not bother to

36
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:48,759
look at but we will be looking at so the

37
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,859
question is what do I do

38
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,620
next if I if I were in this room right

39
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:55,750
now would I I want to go to the thing

40
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:01,658
that Marvin didn't look at so I'm gonna

41
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:04,479
go to the right and I think so if I go

42
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:06,419
to the right god I think I went a little

43
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:11,488
too far actually

44
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:16,199
ah dad no well I think actually what

45
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:18,030
happened is here the problem is that

46
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,608
it's a kind of a branching point I could

47
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,069
stop it could be blocked by the beds or

48
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,120
I could keep going past the bed so the

49
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,709
other side of the room so I could

50
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,680
actually be on either side of the room

51
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:33,949
right now but either way I guess it

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,360
doesn't matter but I'm going to assume

53
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:40,289
I'm on the thing that I got blocked by

54
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,800
the beds and I if I go up up up up just

55
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,460
keep going up there will be a question

56
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,740
mark that appears that will let me go

57
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:53,939
and do something if I press X something

58
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,090
will happen and what will happen I think

59
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,319
possibly a text box will open because

60
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,810
that's what happens with the windmill

61
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:05,370
right I'm gonna press I press X and a

62
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,259
text box appeared with text in it that

63
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,300
is probably cryptic and we don't really

64
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,759
care too much about so we're gonna press

65
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,960
X a bunch of times to get through all

66
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,569
the text but we can look at it later and

67
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,969
there could be a lot of it so be it like

68
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:27,659
a book and there a lot of stuff I don't

69
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:29,250
care about part of it or or it's not a

70
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,830
text box and it could be literally

71
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:36,560
anything else in the world that happens

72
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:40,529
when you when you press X so the next

73
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:46,110
thing I can think to do is just press

74
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:49,168
buttons randomly and chaotically and

75
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,550
hopefully we'll some results so I'm

76
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,879
doing that right now I know if you can

77
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,879
hear that uh

78
00:05:53,689 --> 00:06:13,350
I'm being real thinking you know I'm

79
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,459
thinking I'm being

80
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,459
[Music]

81
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:48,449
I think I'm definitely it's just that we

82
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:56,149
can see yeah what are you doing play

83
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:56,149
this game too much okay

84
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,400
so the windmill isn't there I think I

85
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:14,649
can so I get blocked by the I do get

86
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:17,919
blocked by the beds and I go up I think

87
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:19,239
oh god I could be doing this I shouldn't

88
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,350
be doing this while I'm talking

89
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,569
so anyway well was he so I've seen I've

90
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,879
actually seen recordings that it made of

91
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:32,009
me

92
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:34,959
from a year ago and I had not seen that

93
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:37,149
no recording in the time between so it

94
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:41,709
was holding onto this thing and it only

95
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:46,149
decided a year later to playback there

96
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:47,889
are also recordings that I assume are

97
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:52,000
stored on the CD or might even be

98
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:54,250
scripted but in one of the recent videos

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,600
this is this is one that went on the

100
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,100
public YouTube

101
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:03,640
I lost the video I lost it

102
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:07,360
I had the audio the game had the

103
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:10,779
recording even there were two parts to

104
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,699
this this session I had both of them and

105
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:17,168
played them back two different occasions

106
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:25,240
as demo recordings I got them but okay

107
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:27,430
so here's the thing those those demo

108
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,410
recordings can be different alright they

109
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,569
can be different from when I was playing

110
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:35,649
the one so when I caught all those pets

111
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:37,000
and it showed the text that was

112
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,809
different from what I show up when I was

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,360
playing it shared something it happened

114
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,909
to line up right perfectly same number

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,909
of text boxes and so forth and also the

116
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:54,969
music wasn't there in the demo there can

117
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:57,429
be differences and this was part of what

118
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,550
made it seem reasonable that the door

119
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:02,349
could be open I'm not saying it wasn't

120
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:07,539
still nuts so I'm actually going to do

121
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:09,610
this now so right so I'm assuming that

122
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:11,079
triangle is back but it could be square

123
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:20,590
circle

124
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:23,310
didn't all of them I can actually you

125
00:09:20,590 --> 00:10:03,670
can actually I think you can rotate

126
00:09:23,309 --> 00:10:06,669
these okay so I mean I could have gone

127
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:09,419
just totally off the rails by this point

128
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:09,419
I could be anywhere

129
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:19,278
so it's

130
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:22,420
five was this room over here and now

131
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:28,129
attempt six we're going to try to push a

132
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:32,419
bucket into the other room going back to

133
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:40,299
this room now again got to make sure

134
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:43,299
this is aligned exactly right mm it's

135
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,299
okay

136
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:55,180
and I'm just going to leave it there

137
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:55,179
and see what happens

138
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,089
you

139
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:27,420
turn again this is a tempest 22 that's

140
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:27,420
right I'm talking about that

141
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,320
[Music]

142
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,659
got it

143
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:14,838
all right now we're in the scary part -

144
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:17,838
you know one two three four five six

145
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,839

Here I am

00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:07,409
it deleted my files

155
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,250

you

173
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:10,368
I think

174
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:16,508
I think

175
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,769
I think

176
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:32,539
if that was based

177
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:38,309
off of a conversation

178
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:58,179
that I had last year on my birthday

179
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:58,179
[Music]

180
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:13,239

but I don't know how that magic trick

186
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,779
works exactly

00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:44,888

192
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,829
