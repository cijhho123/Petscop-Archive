1
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:13,739
all right so I spent a while with this

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,670
just asking as many questions as I could

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:22,859
think of mostly like short three words

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,849
aims and most of the questions that I

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,189
asked just produced no answer or the

6
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,710
fall answer a default answer which is I

7
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,439
don't know most of them just gave me

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,179
that except for four of them and I'm

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:43,199
going to go through each of those four

10
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:46,109
now the first of the four was who is

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,309
tiara and the capitalization does not

12
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:54,000
make a difference who is tiara I also

13
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:58,128
tried who is care who is Mike who is

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,308
Michael and I tried other forms to like

15
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:06,948
just care just Mike just Michael this is

16
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:06,948
the only one that gave me anything

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:24,430
next one that I tried oh yeah

18
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,700
next I asked where am I

19
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:34,839
and then I asked who are you I don't

20
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:44,858
know why that just happened yeah so I

21
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:46,569
was saying who-who are you yeah I don't

22
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:48,810
know why that has changed color out of

23
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,810
nowhere

24
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:22,969
I think it broke II yeah I don't think

25
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:28,650
that even just just registered at all or

26
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:31,729
okay so that's not that's not what it

27
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,629
said before when I put in that question

28
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:35,629
did not look anything like that

29
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:51,379
interesting okay what what do I ask now

30
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:14,770
why why turn off I'll try just why okay

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,770
oh boy

32
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,970
you

33
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:54,209
yeah what the

34
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:28,370
this game this game okay all

35
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,370
right what away well I have to ask now

36
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:48,800
and to switch back again I think it just

37
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:48,800
okay I don't

38
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,949
so if I if I put in oh is it

39
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,500
put in who are you again is that going

40
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:01,360
to let me see what happens when I put

41
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,360
that in again

42
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:24,089
yeah so that's what it said originally

43
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:31,709
when I put it in oh well okay that's

44
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:33,539
bizarre so I guess I'm going to wait for

45
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:34,919
that to happen again

46
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,520
but I guess I'm going to end the video

47
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,520
now though

48
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,780
you

49
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,530
you
