just in the other room for a couple of

4
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,179
minutes and I came back and the door was

5
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:45,109
open and I checked the recording because

6
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:48,340
I was recording and the door just opens

7
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,339

little bewildered on know the truth is a

14
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,860

18
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:24,139

19
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:31,569
going to see like one room like

20
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:34,569

21
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,569

[Music]

26
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:40,159
all right so it's been like two minutes

27
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,920
and when those sounds are playing there

28
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,829
was nothing happening as far as I could

29
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,909
tell and nothing has happened since so

30
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:54,710
I'm just going to keep going there's

31
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:57,169
already been stuff that I could dig a

32
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:04,250
little deeper into and I'm going to do

33
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:07,219
that and keep you updated but also when

34
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,029
you come home next month hopefully

35
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,720
you're feeling a little more

36
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:14,990
enthusiastic about that now we can

37
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:19,810
investigate this together and maybe

38
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,810
you'll find stuff that I can't find here

39
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:53,189
Oh what the [ __ ] wait a second

40
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:59,909
what was that just now

41
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:04,469
can I get that to happen again

42
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,519
wait

43
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:21,739
I had to look at that for a moment

44
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:25,179
in the video I was a little nervous the

45
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,139
tones I think this is the same tones

46
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:28,189
that you might have heard in the

47
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:31,240
beginning I'm going to put in the

48
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:35,240
beginning the part where the door opened

49
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:38,990
and also the way the guy on the other

50
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:43,879
side was moving for a moment I'm going

51
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:47,500
to ask for your comment later on that so

52
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:51,379
I was looking around here so this is

53
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:57,919
backwards it says do you remember being

54
00:10:51,379 --> 00:11:03,580
born and this just says Twitter's room

55
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,579
so interestingly I'm on the reverse side

56
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:11,950
here yeah okay so moving on

57
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:38,390
and I'm back up here again this again

58
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,269
okay I'm not going to do that right now

59
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,870
all right so I'm going to stop this now

60
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,870
actually
