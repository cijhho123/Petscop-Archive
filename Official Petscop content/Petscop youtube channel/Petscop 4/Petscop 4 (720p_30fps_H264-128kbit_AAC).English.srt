1
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,070
so if you remember what I was trying to

2
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:26,919
explain yesterday and failed to explain

3
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:42,429
I'm just gonna demonstrate that to you

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:48,189
now so I found this yesterday and the

5
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:51,728
way I understand this is so we're

6
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:57,088
upstairs right now you just saw me walk

7
00:00:51,728 --> 00:01:01,378
up some stairs so if you were to imagine

8
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:05,709
what is what would be exactly below

9
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:07,950
where I'm standing right now and I

10
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:11,589
worked it out it's roughly the area

11
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:18,070
where you have the big screen with the

12
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:20,759
windmill and so I think so this this I

13
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:28,349
think is a camera and the fyah

14
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:34,030
walk in this direction this is roughly

15
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:35,649
where the windmill would be why there

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:39,009
isn't actually a windmill here I don't

17
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:52,840
know it looks sort of like a placeholder

18
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:53,438
for it yeah I think my understanding is

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,069
correct

20
00:01:53,438 --> 00:02:02,968
it's just I'm missing something okay

21
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,969
that's it
