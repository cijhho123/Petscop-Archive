00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,419
you

3
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:28,076
[Music]

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:39,460
all right so this is just to prove to

5
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:42,189
you because I'm not lying about this I'm

6
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:47,230
gonna walk you through everything that

7
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:49,238
I've seen so far and obviously to be

8
00:00:47,229 --> 00:01:27,280
exactly as I described it because this

9
00:00:49,238 --> 00:01:28,929
is it and the first level is over here

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,060
I'm just going to keep going to right

11
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:32,500
here so you can see that the game is

12
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,478
apparently unfinished because there's

13
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,750
nothing over here so I'm just going to

14
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,039
show you the one and only level this

15
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,899
actually it's not the interesting part

16
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:45,250
but I'm just going to show you I'm going

17
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,140
to walk you through all this so you can

18
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,560
see that this is exactly what I

19
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,560
described

20

[Music]

21
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:04,284
[Music]

22
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:12,776
[Music]

23
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:49,519
first pets in this room and first thing

24
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:55,459
you got to do here is let her out of a

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:03:03,340
cage she just moves by the other one and

26
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:03,340
then you do that take the mama here

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,909
and then actually go over here and just

28
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:17,225
does that but if you do this if you lock

29
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:20,305
yourself in here that is run over there

30
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:20,306
[Music]

31
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,459
so once you're in here actually you can

32
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:31,780
find a little place here to walk to the

33
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:35,560
other side that's that and so there's

34
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:39,459
actually this another over here I can't

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,590
catch this one I've tried this is always

36
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,949
what happens so I don't know what's up

37
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,830
with that one so actually actually show

38
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:52,315
you the pause menu but here you can see

39
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,319
all the pets that you

40
00:03:52,316 --> 00:04:10,259
[Music]

41
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:19,019
collected we've caught all right so

42
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:20,548
second one here is sort of music one the

43
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,228
idea here is you have to get your phone

44
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:27,810
over there to overlap with it and I'll

45
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:40,439
just cut to the chase you just set this

46
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:51,779
to what is it seventh and like that -

47
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:54,449
let me get that one all right so this

48
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,009
one's kind of interesting so the idea is

49
00:04:54,449 --> 00:05:00,660
you weren't over here to catch a flower

50
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:02,788
here then you let's get rained on what

51
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,970
you're supposed to do is whenever the

52
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:07,709
flower comes over here you notice always

53
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,540
comes to the exact spot over there which

54
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:16,729
you can get this okay

55
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,730
that exact five

56
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:25,628
that's a spot yeah then the and that

57
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:35,139
happens and you'll be just catching boat

58
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:37,840
that way so yeah that's it for the

59
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:40,028
actual that's everything it's every

60
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,908
single pet here that I've been able to

61
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:45,718
catch so now we're going to show you the

62
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,718
part that's actually interesting

63
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,519
all right so I still can't catch this

64
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:58,500
guy the reason we're here is because in

65
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,689
the note that came with this which is

66
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,699
short the first line and all capital

67
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:06,478
letters I'm going to read it it says I

68
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:09,180
walked down stairs and when I got to the

69
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,089
bottom instead of proceeding

70
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:17,900
I turned the right and became a shadow

71
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:23,369
monster man though that a date June 13

72
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:26,758
1997 for you : please go to my website

73
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:31,889
on the sticker and also go to Cronus

74
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:37,770
room and press Start and press down down

75
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:39,269
down down down right start so I happen

76
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:43,439
to know this is run on strim because it

77
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:47,549
works so I go here I'm just going to do

78
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:51,560
this now why is it down down down down

79
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:55,228
down right sorry

80
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,699
alright so you can see that it accepted

81
00:06:55,228 --> 00:07:03,689
it and the music stopped I'm just going

82
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:08,218
to go out this way here so uh it appears

83
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:13,158
to be the same except and actually leave

84
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:13,158
here it'll be a little bit different

85
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:43,069
alright so there's nothing out here as

86
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,710
far as I've seen but actually I think

87
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,839
there is something out here I just

88
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:53,508
haven't seen again

89
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:54,799
because it sure seems like and there's

90
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,000
no here sure seems like right I'm

91
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
supposed to come out here and look at

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,478
something I haven't found anything yet

93
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,620
but I'm thinking if I just keep walking

94
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,318
around here I'm going to find something

95
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,149
eventually I say

96
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,759
hey so I was talking about who I

97
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:13,038
couldn't find anything out here well I

98
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,749
just found this and last time I came out

99
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,829
here I was walking around in this space

100
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:21,669
here for over an hour and this time I

101
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:24,468
find this in less than 15 minutes so

102
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:27,829
this is just luck that I happen to find

103
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:29,418
this and I think if I were to restart my

104
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:31,639
console right now I would not be able to

105
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:35,809
find this again probably because I don't

106
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:40,698
remember what I what I did you know all

107
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:42,679
the directions that I went so so I'm

108
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:45,859
kind of scared to you know I want to

109
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,689
keep the console on until I figure this

110
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,800
out the situation is that I cannot open

111
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:54,860
this door I probably can't open the door

112
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:57,740
but I don't know what to do so I thought

113
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,209
I would just slip this in at the end if

114
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,339
you think you saw something that might

115
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:07,750
provide a clue please let me know all

116
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,750
right that's it
