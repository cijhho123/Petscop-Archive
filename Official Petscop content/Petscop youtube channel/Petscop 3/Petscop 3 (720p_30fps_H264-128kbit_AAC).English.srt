1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
all right so now we're going to look at

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:49,200
what's over here which I forgot about

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:51,799
this what's that think I have to put

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,800
something there

5
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,609
what

6
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,060
Oh

7
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,890
you

8
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,599
okay

9
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:47,229
all right okay

10
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,209
just flat-out full game I'm playing

11
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,818
or mine

12
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:44,849
I don't think I'm supposed to do that

13
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:44,849
yeah yeah I reset it okay try that again

14
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,030
sterilizes way

15
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:20,719
I think that's wrong

16
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,729
or a different something in there

17
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:37,860
yeah it turned out I just had to wait

18
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:42,829
but I had to wait a while so this is

19
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,830
cleared out I guess so what's in here

20
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:24,168
okay alright let's try another one I

21
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,870
guess so I just did it again I put in

22
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:27,139
another one of these and I just let it

23
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,959
go

24
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:34,269
and it and the room rumbles for a while

25
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:41,079
but then it just stops kind of abruptly

26
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:41,079
so we have here now yeah

27
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,668
yeah so it seems like I put in one of

28
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:59,910
these faces and it gives me a room with

29
00:04:54,668 --> 00:05:04,689
a guy that's a kid sitting on the bed

30
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:10,919
and like a different pattern on the

31
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:15,069
floor and the walls and the same here so

32
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:20,620
it seems like there are many

33
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:23,348
combinations of these faces so if I were

34
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,848
to guess these rooms are because there's

35
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:26,709
not much variation between these rooms

36
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:30,219
they're probably generated in some way

37
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:33,638
and so I'll try a few more every time I

38
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:37,030
put in one of these I have to wait for

39
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,550
like ten minutes so I'm not going to try

40
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:44,250
too many of them

41
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,250
yeah here's another one

42
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:02,339
and here's another

43
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,879
yeah

44
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:25,110
so anything look familiar here yeah yeah

45
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,389
so probably we're supposed to try these

46
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,990
out put in these faces and see what we

47
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,990
get so start with this one

48
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:54,209
so this is a room corresponding to the

49
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:54,209
face on the grave stones

50
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,610
not sure what that is on the right

51
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:20,469
alright gonna try the other one now I

52
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:22,949
guess nothing nothing to see here the

53
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,950
beds empty

54
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:48,539
here's the other room and it looks like

55
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,540
there's something here

56
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:38,428
unless you what to say about that

57
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:54,610
but I'm wondering now because the note

58
00:09:48,240 --> 00:10:06,778
remember the note that came with this

59
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:09,730
game it said for you it was for you and

60
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:17,889
this note is referring to the player

61
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:24,970
it's saying you and I was already

62
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:29,350
thinking this but it seems like it's

63
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,670
possible this game was made for well

64
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,620
this part of the game was made for

65
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:43,679
somebody see like or at least at some

66
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:43,679
point it was it was a I don't know I

67
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:51,129
don't know it just seems like there is

68
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:53,549
is intended for somebody not me

69
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:53,549
certainly

70
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:15,649
okay we're still not done because we

71
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:15,649
still have whatever is over here or not

72
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:36,839
okay so okay I'll just end this here

73
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,838
then
