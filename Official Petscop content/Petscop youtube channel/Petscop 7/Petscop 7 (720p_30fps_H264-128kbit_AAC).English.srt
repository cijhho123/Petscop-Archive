1
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,500
you

2
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:59,470
[Music]

3
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:24,219
[Music]

4
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,180
you

5
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:37,600
oh hi there

6
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:58,868
that might be it

7
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:09,549
subways okay

8
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:50,909
so we might know who Marvin is now all I

9
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:56,979
need to be quick about this actually

10
00:02:50,909 --> 00:03:01,300
because I could turn red again so I'm

11
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:04,929
going to ask who are you which I feel

12
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,469
like we know at this point but good to

13
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,469
confirm

14
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:36,670
talking about the house again it's

15
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:46,390
interesting but it is not an answer to

16
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:54,250
my question it not at all so what do you

17
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:55,299
think that means okay I should so yeah

18
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,629
so now I'm going to ask the other

19
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:04,000
question but do you remember being born

20
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:08,519
oh yeah it's just remember being born

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,520
because the whole thing does not fit

22
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,569
machine beyond school basement stairway

23
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:46,589
not also not an answer to my question uh

24
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,469
yeah and it was yeah well

25
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:23,990
well there you go okay I guess I'm an

26
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:33,379
idiot

27
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:46,550
I want to try that I guess I mean these

28
00:05:33,379 --> 00:06:02,779
are people right there's my work so if I

29
00:05:46,550 --> 00:06:05,050
walk over here okay so that's another

30
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,049
thing

31
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:50,209
anything out of the ordinary here it's

32
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:58,680
on the floor looks like a gift box and

33
00:06:50,209 --> 00:07:10,168
stars and something else and anything

34
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:11,280
down here as usual no so this if you're

35
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:15,959
wondering what I'm doing here this is

36
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,098
Mike's face but without the eyebrows and

37
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,870
why am i doing that

38
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:27,000
well because eyebrows seem to be

39
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:28,889
important that's really it but nothing

40
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,720
seems to have actually it seems like

41
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:36,180
it's just right one just regular room

42
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,180
right yeah okay

43
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,079
I don't know because that's it I have

44
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,079
one more thing to try though

45
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,609
this one is care with eyebrows

46
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:32,370
so this is care with eyebrows

47
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:32,370
I put Mike's eyebrows on her

48
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:45,789
I could have other eyebrows on her but I

49
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:52,480
didn't on foot Mike Center I don't know

50
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:55,870
if this I I can't tell I can't tell if

51
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:02,610
it recognized it or not because

52
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:12,090
everything looks like any other room

53
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:12,090
this here it puts this

54
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,528
I don't know maybe that's just something

55
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:26,528
that it puts in any room

56
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,429
you

57
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,609
you
