1
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,400
What?

2
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:50,339
Uhh. What?

3
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,920
This is Marvin, right?

4
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,099
This is Marvin.

5
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,119
I think you're confused, Marvin.

6
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,739
Don't think you know what you're,

7
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,460
I don't think you get what you're, uh, what you're doing.

8
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,359
What?

9
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,600
Excuse me?

10
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,560
He went up.

11
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,120
Will I find him if I go up?

12
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,760
I don't know.

13
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,659
Yeah, well, the thing is, it's not here now.

14
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:28,319
There's not even a passageway or anything.

15
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,739
Can you remember when you saw this?

16
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,579
Well, it could have changed between then and 2004.

17
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,400
After 2004 my mom had it, purportedly.

18
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:55,419
Hmm.

19
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,699
Well, okay. Thanks--
