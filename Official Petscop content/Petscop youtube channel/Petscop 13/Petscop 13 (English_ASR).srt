[Applause]

2
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:38,018
looks like we finally made some progress

3
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:49,780
I think well just to figure out what to

4
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:51,789
do with it you know it probably has to

5
00:00:49,780 --> 00:01:26,170
do it this thing than the tool in the

6
00:00:51,789 --> 00:01:34,180
room yeah try to get that yeah these two

7
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:36,990
are definitely blocking it

8
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,990
that means

9
00:01:37,930 --> 00:02:07,950
[Applause]

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:02:09,370
all right so it comes up if I oh wow

11
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:32,400
okay

12
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:32,400
[Applause]

13
00:02:55,449 --> 00:03:01,280
okay there's a new file you might might

14
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,270
have occurred to you as it occurred to

15
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:10,340
me that these rooms are but in this room

16
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:12,500
and the house our counterparts if they

17
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,250
both have this bucket and they're shaped

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:27,189
similarly so I thought I would try out

19
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:29,090
what we did before yeah and it worked

20
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:37,489
God I'm not gonna be able to get this

21
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:44,480
sewer okay hmm good eye this is working

22
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:48,610
out pretty well and I'm feeling some

23
00:03:44,479 --> 00:04:00,189
doubt because this seems way too

24
00:03:48,610 --> 00:04:00,190
small but I should not have felt out I

25
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,539
just

26
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,060
