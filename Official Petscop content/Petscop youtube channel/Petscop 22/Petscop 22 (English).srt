1
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,160
Hey there.

2
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,920
How's it going?

3
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,159
Yeah, I'm okay. What do you think of that picture?

4
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,960
Yeah, so I,

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,100
I, I went up, and I typed  "where is the windmill?",

6
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,880
and that didn't work,

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,700
and so, uh,

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,200
I tried "where was the windmill?"

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,820
and that's how I got the text.

10
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,899
In the picture.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,260
Yeah. Yeah, I looked them up.

12
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:03,920
The top numbers, I looked them up.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,100
Uh,

14
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,699
you, you're gonna want to look them up yourself.

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,739
Yeah, punch 'em in.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,140
Yeah.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,620
I'll wait.

18
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,020
It's a, it's a two.

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,480
I know!

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,540
I know, me too.

21
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,320
That, that was what, f-- first thought. First thought.

22
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,659
There's not a lot of detail.

23
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,879
Uh, but,

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,639
it looks like a stone, right?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,259
Not yet, actually, I wanted to go with you, tomorrow.

26
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,919
Uh, that's why I...

27
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,699
we, yeah.

28
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,699
Friday.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,340
How about that?

30
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,479
Okay. No, I'm gonna sit on it, until then.

31
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,959
I'm, I'm not showing the family until I've seen it myself.

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,659
Yeah... well, I don't, I don't,

33
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,039
I don't know, I'm not recording. I stopped it.

34
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,959
Uh, so, what do you think of the bottom numbers?

35
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,780
No, they're different. I wanna hear what you think, first.

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,200
Mm, ye-- yeah, yup. Yup.

37
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,179
Yup.

38
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,699
Yeah, we, we would have to find out how big.

39
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:13,319
Like, we have to find out how big a tile is,

40
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,479
one of the tiles.

41
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,400
Like, if we, if we could figure out how big

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,460
one tile is,

43
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,019
in uni--, in, um, like, feet.

44
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,320
Or, uh yeah, meters.

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,860
If we could...

46
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,880
what I'm thinking is, if we could measure how far away

47
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,319
the staircase is,

48
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,620
the, the staircase is, from the windmill,

49
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,180
the staircase closest, you know,

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,420
the one that's closest to the windmill,

51
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,199
if we could measure how far away that is,

52
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,519
from the windmill,

53
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,480
what I'm wondering,

54
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,299
is, if we could find something there.

55
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,760
Yeah. Yeah.

56
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,280
Yeah, exactly, we could do that.

57
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,159
Uh, it's, uh,

58
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,120
I mean, this is, this,

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,819
it's unlikely, this is already pretty...

60
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,219
It's exciting.

61
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,460
This is why I'm not telling the family, because it's exciting. Uh.

62
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,359
Um, but it's unlikely, but it's still, it's still worth a try,

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,759
and, what I think, what I'm thinking

64
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,620
we should do,

65
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,660
go and measure the stone on the ground,

66
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,660
compare it to the size of the windmill in the game,

67
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,320
and then we can use that for conversions.

68
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,259
Which, we can do it based on tiles,

69
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,920
how far we can walk in a second, like speed,

70
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,319
whatever, whatever is the easy way to

71
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,300
do what I'm thinking.

72
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,640
Sure.

73
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,360
And, oh, I think it's more, I think it's more likely we

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,300
could use real life to find things in the game,

75
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,180
like, the reverse.

76
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:04,899
Um,

77
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,339
which, we can, we can do that,

78
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,799
and then we don't have to, like, aimlessly walk around to find stuff.

79
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,520
That would be interesting.

80
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,579
Right? If we could take...

81
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,339
That, that's, yup. Yup.

82
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,740
I know, isn't this...

83
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,840
I can probably just measure the stone now, from the,

84
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,199
from the satellite right now, roughly.

85
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:33,139
Uh, no, they don't know much more than we do now. They didn't...

86
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,239
I don't like talking to them. They intimidate me.

87
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,280
Uh, and I'm sure they wouldn't intimidate you, at all.

88
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,659
Yeah, have they called you?

89
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,680
They haven't called you, right?

90
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,720
I mean, Jill specifically, she hasn't called you?

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,839
No, I, I didn't voluntarily mention you.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,500
She asked,

93
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,279
because,

94
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,379
'cause, you know, I'm talking to you in the first few videos.

95
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,219
Right? And so she asked who, who I'm talking to

96
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,200
in the videos, and so I told her, but,

97
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,879
she didn't ask anything else, so I don't think she actually cares.

98
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,660
Yeah.

99
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,479
And, I don't, and you don't have to worry about it, right? 'Cause,

100
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,540
'cause you aren't, you aren't family, so you wouldn't have a room.

101
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,319
That's the thing.

102
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,560
Uh.

103
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,340
I, I didn't mean it that way, just,

104
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,779
you probably don't have a room, that's, that's my only point.

105
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,379
Yeah, no, it's fine.

106
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,420
Uh, no, you don't want her calling you anyway.

107
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,960
Like, you won't be able,

108
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,199
you won't be able to escape, that's the thing,

109
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,219
if she were to start... yeah.

110
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,639
And I should start taking you up on that offer.

111
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,699
Hey, I need your genius.

112
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,220

Yeah, I need your, I need your puzzle genius.

116

No, no, you're,

117

you're a genius.

118
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,159
Wait, let me,

119
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,439
let me get there before I start talking about this.

120
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,240
You sure?

121
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,759
Yeah. You weren't in the middle of something, were you?

122
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,779
I can let you go.

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,040
Good, well, okay, so,

124
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I was expecting the cage puzzle to lead into something else,

125
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,180
Uh, but there's really nothing here

126
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,480
left.

127
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,159
Yeah. Um.

128
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,319
The Tiara character is gone, now.

129
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,939
Yeah, completely, like, you look over on the other side,

130
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,779
and now there's noth-- there was, there was,

131
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,779
like, the, the Tiara character was there,

132
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,519
and then I left, and then the next time I came back,

133
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,399
they were gone.

134
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,039
What do you mean, "of course"?

135
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,039
Give me a second to verify that logic.

where the cars pass by, and they never hit me?

154
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
