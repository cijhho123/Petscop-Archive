Everything we wish to say is below: 

The purpose of this YouTube channel is to preserve and display the recordings within the video game "Petscop" while keeping some of their content private. 

They were first given to us as a Christmas gift, many years ago. The game had an interesting journey, before and after that day. 

Paul created some additional recordings in 2017 as a way to show Petscop gameplay to his friend. He created this account in order to upload those additional recordings in video format. He later passed ownership of the channel to us, but continued to record himself at our strong suggestion. Though he had issues with the arrangement, these have finally been settled. 

Please enjoy the recordings in Petscop! We do. :)
