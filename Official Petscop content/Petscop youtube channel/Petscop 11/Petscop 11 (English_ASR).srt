1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,369
signs along the way that I ignored did

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:14,808
say what a completely ridiculous idea to

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:18,420
me but when I found my room

4
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:21,089
it made well I was shocked at first but

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,500
it made sense especially considering

6
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:27,089
where I found the game in the first

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:33,840
place that would be tied in some way to

8
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:45,450
me through you trying to think when was

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:48,960
the last time I saw any of you at all it

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:59,039
had to have been like 1999 I was a kid I

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:01:04,859
was a small kid tiny kid and after that

12
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:15,329
just you know it would make sense in the

13
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:18,150
timeline it's hard to do this while I'm

14
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,329
talking that's why I'm so quiet right

15
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,330
now

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,049
so if you're wondering what I'm doing

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,930
right now I have a drawing that I could

18
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:37,020
scan and send to you I just came home

19
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:39,479
and drew this big drawing and it still

20
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,030
you still need an explanation on because

21
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,810
they thought the drawing is not very

22
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,310
clear what scribbles really but um but

23
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:58,799
you need the visual to understand the

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:02:03,530
explanation alright so you need both I'm

25
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,530
about 90% sure this is gonna work and

26
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:10,550
10% not so sure but mostly sure

27
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:39,830
okay wait what do you think it is all

28
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:46,879
wrong again holy holy it works

29
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:50,200
I mean I was 90% sure but it's a little

30
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,199
shocking that it actually worked

31
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:59,780
that's very neat all right so the way

32
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,840
this works I'm supposed to pass on this

33
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,840
one

34
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:43,189
there it is okay okay so this one we

35
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:46,010
want to what we want to when asked about

36
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:48,639
the house so we're gonna ask clear just

37
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:48,639
where his house

38
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:19,639
okay um so I don't I don't know I I mean

39
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,250
this probably say asked me to go this

40
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:33,259
way right yeah I think that's what's

41
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:39,350
happening that's not what I was

42
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:43,370
expecting actually I guess a a road

43
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,750
makes sense but it's not visually the

44
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:55,879
same thing that I was expecting to see

45
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:58,220
see what the camera just did there it's

46
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:09,939
a frozen house I think we found the

47
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:09,940
house just found the house

48
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:32,189
from the house like he's still what what

49
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:43,560
you can't open it

50
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:43,560
I joked about I can't open doors

51
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,439
you

52
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:59,739
clockwise the top is going to right and

53
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:03,459
then you know the bottom is going to the

54
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,350
left right and so once you wanted to say

55
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,418
righty-tighty lefty-loosey or you know

56
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,199
you turn this turn this thing to the to

57
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:13,508
the right and I mean I still get

58
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,819
confused about that because I mean

59
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:20,610
though I know it's always the top but I

60
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,610
still have to think I have to think what

61
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:33,478
we have the door open now so I mean okay

62
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:51,149
all right okay it's interesting that

63
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,150
people appearing and disappearing

64
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,439
calendars here

65
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,399
[Music]

66
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:11,469
so these are different years this green

67
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:18,009
here starts off like checkerboard and

68
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:32,180
whatever this is and then weekends it's

69
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:39,229
green every day oh okay I don't know if

70
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:46,870
you got that immediately yes June to

71
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:51,520
November mm-hmm yeah on that topic I

72
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,519
don't remember meeting this girl at all

73
00:08:51,950 --> 00:09:01,970
I don't remember knowing her at any

74
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:10,750
point I remember you saying that we were

75
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:10,750
that we we are exactly the same age I

76
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:21,259
don't I just don't remember even hearing

77
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,690
about anyone going missing all right I

78
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:28,549
don't have a single remember her going

79
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:32,660
missing or anything like that I mean I

80
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:33,919
was a kid but even then it could've been

81
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:38,750
one of those periods when we weren't

82
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:41,539
visiting very much but she's weird right

83
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:46,549
because no if you can you can verify

84
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:49,149
these dates but fifth of June 10th of

85
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,149
November

86
00:09:49,799 --> 00:10:03,778
right when she went missing and when she

87
00:09:52,789 --> 00:10:06,539
was found right and the 25th year I'm

88
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:10,350
wondering what the what the animation

89
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:17,009
means there right now the number is

90
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:19,409
animating a bit because right the 25th

91
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:22,828
of December on both calendars but

92
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:25,828
they're different years so I don't know

93
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:27,500
if it means it's the 25th of December in

94
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:32,309
this house but then it's two different

95
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:47,778
years so that's do agree there's a

96
00:10:32,309 --> 00:11:12,059
resemblance very strong resemblance

97
00:10:47,778 --> 00:11:14,509
between us what the hell that was an

98
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,509
experience

99
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,959
